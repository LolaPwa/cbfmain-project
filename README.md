# React + Vite
Vite is a build tool used together with React, for optimised development and server performance; ensuring instant hot module replacement (HMR). Hot module replacement ensures that when React components or other modules, the changes are reflected instantly in the browser, without needing a full page reload.

# JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

- A third party API for the enablement of a seamless login experience via the user email address.Firebase authentication supports Google sign-In to authenticate users in this firbase powered app.
# Cookie-parser
- Used as middleware in the express framework so route handlers can access cookies which are small pieces of data sent to the client browser from the server. Cookie-parser is used for session management, user authentication and user behaviour.
# MongoDB
- provides a flexible and scalable approach to data storage with no strict requirements for the structure of documents with a collection.
# Redux Toolkit
- For dynamic routing redux is a set of tools and utilities that simplifies the process of state management.
